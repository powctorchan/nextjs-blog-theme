# Variables and Mutability

Starting with the following code :

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

Save and run this code by using `cargo run`,then you would receive an error message like:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.
error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error

```

The error message indicates that the cause of the error is that you `cannot assign twice to immutable variable `'x'`, because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable `x variable.

The Rust compiler guarantees that the value you state won't change its value as variables are immutable  by default

However, mutability can be useful sometimes , hence ,we can adding `mut` in front of the variable name.

In this way, we can change the code above like:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

We’re allowed to change the value bound to `x` from `5` to `6` when `mut` is used.

# Constants

Like immutable variables, *constants* are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

1. `mut` can't be used to modify constants
2. using `const`not `let` to declare constants 
3. the type of value must be annotated

For instance:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
}
```

> Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. 

Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in. 

# Shadowing

The code below shows the concepts of shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

Usually, Rustaceans say that the first variable is *shadowed* by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what the program sees when the variable is used.

By repeating the use of the `let` keywords,we can shadow a variable using the exactly same name.

## Difference 

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` ,'cause  it's gonna wrong if you try to reassign to a variable without using `let` .

So we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that shadowing is an effective ways to creating a new variable but reuse the same name 

Like the example below:

```rust
fn main() {
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
}

fn main() {
    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();
}

```

The first case can be compiled ,however the second one would show some error

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:3:14
  |
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error

```

# Data Types

Every value in Rust is of certain *data type*.

Rust is a *statically typed* language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time . In fact , the Rust compiler can infer what type we want to use according to the value. However ,in some specific cases,the compiler could not infer the type,as when we needed to converted a `String` to a numeric type using `parse` ,we must add a type annotation like:

```rust

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
}

```

If we don’t add the type annotation here, Rust will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:

```
$ cargo build
   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^ consider giving `guess` a type

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0282`.
error: could not compile `no_type_annotations` due to previous error

```

# Scalar Types

A *scalar* type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

## Integer Types

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. *Signed* and *unsigned* refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be negative

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown below. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

| Number literals  | Example       |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |

## Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` (single-precision)and `f64`(double-precision)

The default type is `f64`

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. 

## Numeric Operations

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer.

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}

```

 ## The Boolean Type 

a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`.

## The Character Type 

Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here’s some examples of declaring `char` values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'ℤ';
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}

```

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. 

# Compound Types

 Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

## The Tuple Type 

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: ***once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.***

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same.

like:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}

```

To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}

```

> This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then uses a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called *destructuring*

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For instance:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}

```

> The first index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values, `()`, is a special type that has only one value, also written `()`. The type is called the *unit type* and the value is called the *unit value*.

## The Array Type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an *array* whose elements must have the same type. Meanwhile,unlike arrays in some other language ,array in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}

```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.

You write an array’s type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```rust

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}

```

> `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5` indicates the array contains five elements.

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:

```rust

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let a = [3; 5];
}

```

The array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value `3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a more concise way.

### Accessing Array Elements

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}

```

### Invalid Array Element Access

what gonna happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        "The value of the element at index {} is: {}",
        index, element
    );
}

```

This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using `cargo run` and enter 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will print out the corresponding value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the array, such as 10, you’ll see output like this:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

```

The program resulted in a *runtime* error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and didn’t execute the final `println!` statement. When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic.

# Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code.

The `main`function is of vital importance as it is the entry of the program

Through `fn` keyword ,we can define the function and its following name and the set of parentheses.

For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}

```

> Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.

## Parameters

We can define functions to have *parameters*, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. 

Adding a parameter for the code above:

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

In function signatures, you *must* declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean.

When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {}{}", value, unit_label);
}

```

# Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

Those function that we have been mentioned didn't include an ending expression

However,Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. 

*Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value. Take an example :

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}

```

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}

```

It will receive an error :

``` 
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)

```

***The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for `x` to bind to.***

Expression will finally evaluate to a value.Taking`5+6`for instance , it is an expression that will be the value `11`

Expressions can be part of statements,the `6` in statement `let y= 6`is an expression that evaluates to value `6`.

Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}

```

The expression

```rust
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}

```



should be noted that no semicolon at the end like what we did learn 

Adding a semicolon to the end of the expression will turn to a statement

# Function with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (`->`).

In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function,meanwhile ,you can return early from a functions using `return`keywordand specifying a value,but most functions return the last expression implicitly.

For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

```

if we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from an expression to a statement, we’ll get an error.

as follow:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:24
  |
7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |    --------            ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`
  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
8 |     x + 1;
  |          - help: consider removing this semicolon

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `functions` due to previous error

```

The main error message, “mismatched types,” reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the function `plus_one` says that it will return an `i32`, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by `()`, the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an error.
