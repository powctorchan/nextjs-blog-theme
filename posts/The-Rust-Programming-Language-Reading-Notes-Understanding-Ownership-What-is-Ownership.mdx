# What is Ownership

*Ownership* is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory.

Traditionally,there are two kinds of methods to managing the way of using the computer's memory :

1. using garbage collection that looks for no-longer used memory as it runs
2. the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory

Though,Rust uses the third way--memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.

if the rules are violated ,the program won't compile.

## The Stack and the Heap

You are required to think about the stack and the heap more often when you are using Rust  than many other programming languages.

Typically, whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions. 

Owing to the parts of the concepts of the `ownership` being related to the stack and the heap,it is necessary to have a brief comprehension of both concepts.

Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways.

The stack,for example, stores the value in the order it gets them and removes the value in the opposite order which is referred to as *last in,first out*

All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a *pointer*, which is the address of that location. 

Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.

# Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Work through the examples below and illustrate the rules

## Variable Scope

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.

Considering the variable:

```rust
let s = "hello";
```

The variable `s` refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at which it’s declared until the end of the current *scope*.

```rust
fn main() {
    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
}
```

In a nut shell

`s` is valid when comes into scope,but vice versa when goes out of the scope

## The String Type

We have been seen string literals,where a string value is hardcoded into the program.

However it might not be so convenient and suitable for every situation when we are dealing with text.

One reason is that they’re immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code like trying to store what the user input.

In this situations,Rust has a second string type, `String`. This type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String` from a string literal using the `from` function.

```rust 
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon :: operator allows to use namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`.

```rust
	let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

Why can `String` be mutated but literals cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.

## Memory and Allocation

In the case of a string literal,the contents are known at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. String literals are fast and efficient due to its immutability.

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our `String`.

That first part is done by us: when we call `String::from`, its implementation requests the memory it needs.

However,the second part is quite different.

Typically,in those languages with a garbage collector(GC),the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn't being used anymore. There is no needs to think about it.

But,in those who don't have a GC,we need to identify when memory is no longer being used and call code to explicitly return it,just as did to request it.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
}

```

 When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop), and it’s where the author of `String` can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket,which has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written.

## Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move

Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
}

```

 Just like any other languages doing, it binds the value `5` to `x`; then make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`.” We now have two variables, `x` and `y`, and both equal `5`. 

Integers are simple values with a known, fixed size,and those are pushed onto the stack.

Focus the figure below

![String in memory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-01.svg)

We can know that a `String` is made up of three parts: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length and a capacity

The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` is currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the `String` has received from the allocator.

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack,not those data on the heap

![s1 and s2 pointing to the same value](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-02.svg)

The operation `s2 = s1` ,copying the data on the heap,could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large. Rust don't do this.

Meanwhile, here a problem comes: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory known as the *double free* error.

Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1`, the `s1` is no longer valid.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{}, world!", s1);
}
```

and the outcome like

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
2 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
4 | 
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value borrowed here after move

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

You might know the terms *shallow copy* and *deep copy*. Copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably may sound like making a shallow copy,but Rust invalidates the first variable at the same time, so we call it as *move* instead of calling it a *shallow* copy.

![s1 moved to s2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-04.svg)

## Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone

What if we do want to a 'deep' copy of the data on heap.

In that case, we can use a common method called `clone`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
}

```

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown below

![s1 and s2 to two places](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-03.svg)

# Stack-Only Data: Copy

What about those code using integers?

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
}
```

This code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. 

There is no need to prevent `x` from being valid after we create the variable `y`. So calling `clone` wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack like integers are. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, a variable is still valid after assignment to another variable. 

Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. 

So what types implement the `Copy` trait? 

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

Check the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) for further.

# Ownership and Functions

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.

The code below will show us an example of that.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

If we tried to use `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding code to `main` that uses `s` and `x` to see where you can use them and where the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

## Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```
